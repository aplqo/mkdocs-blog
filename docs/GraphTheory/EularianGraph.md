# Eularian Graph

## definition

Eulerian Path
:    A walk on the graph edges of a graph which uses each graph edge in the original graph exactly once.

Eulerian Cycle
:    A trail which starts and ends at the same graph vertex. In other words, it is a graph cycle which uses each graph edge exactly once.

Eulerian Graph
:    An Eulerian graph is a graph containing an Eulerian cycle.

## Test

- A connected simple graph is Eulerian iff it has no graph vertices of odd degree(i.e., all vertices are of even degree).
- A directed graph is Eulerian iff every graph vertex has equal indegree and outdegree.
- A connected graph has an Eulerian path iff it has at most two graph vertices of odd degree.
